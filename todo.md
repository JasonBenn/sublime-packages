#### Sublime Settings

---

* Work on DashDoc.sublime-settings
  * File - preferences - docsets contains the lowercase names you need.
  * Install more gem docsets. What have my last few gemfiles contained?
  * psql docsets should open when writing files of syntax "SQL (PostgreSQL)" - why isn't that working?!

* Text pastry
  * Shortcut shouldn't be like "new file" (it's super+opt+n). It should be like package control (super+leftshift+p). Maybe super+rightshift+p?

* How do I version control all files in User with extension .sublime-settings?
